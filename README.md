Hall Pass Please
================

Hall Pass Please is a document-checking role-playing game.  Navigate the
minefields of high school politics while attempting to bring order to the
hallways, earn extra credit, and perhaps even find a date for prom.

Hall Pass Please is an homage to (or ripoff of) Papers Please from 3909.
